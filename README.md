# ResponsivePatterns

Website created using the PluralSight tutorial to learn Bootstrap

Turned this into a couple different Websites:
1. *ResponsivePatterns* - Created following the steps from PluralSight. Uses all the resources from the tutorial.
2. *MyOwnResponsiveWebsite* - Shows how to use Bootstrap columns for different device sizes.
    * Modified version of the above only using my own ideas. Concepts and format came from above. Resources came from the web.
3. *SinglePageSite* - Shows how to create a single page site.
    * Forked from #2. Wanted to keep #2 and #3 their own seperate sites. Same concepts and ideas as number one, but with my own style.
