# ResponsivePatterns

Website created using the PluralSight tutorial to learn Bootstrap

Turned this into a couple different Websites:
1. *ResponsivePatterns* - Created following the exact steps from PluralSight.
2. *MyOwnResponsiveWebsite* - Modified version of the above only using my own ideas. Concepts and format came from above. Shows how to use Bootstrap columns for different device sizes.
3. *SinglePageSite* - Forked from #2. Wanted to keep #2 and #3 their own seperate sites. Shows how to create a single page site.
