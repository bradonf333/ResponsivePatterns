# ResponsivePatterns

Website created using the PluralSight tutorial to learn Bootstrap
Turned this into a couple different Websites:
1. ResponsivePatterns - Created following the exact steps from PluralSight.
2. MyOwnResponsiveWebsite - Modified version of the above only using my own ideas. Concepts and format came from above.
