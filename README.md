# Websites

These are websites I have created. 

Some of them are created following tutorials on PluralSight, some are my own creations based of tutorials I have seen or ideas I have gotten from following those tutorials.

Turned this into a couple different Websites:
1. **ResponsivePatterns** - Created following the steps from PluralSight. Uses all the resources from the tutorial.
2. **SinglePageSite** - Shows how to create a single page website.
    * Forked from #1. Wanted to keep #1 its own seperate site. This is based off the same concepts and ideas as #1, but with my own style.
3. **SinglePageSite - VideoBG** - Shows how to use a video background in a single page site
    * Modified version of the above.
